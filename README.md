## Workflow:
- Define the segments and the score using [this tool](https://oraziogallo.github.io/game_scoring/). Download the JSON file.
- Drag and drop the JSON file on the game_scoring app and be patient---it'll take several minutes.

## Setup
- Download game_scoring.zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/oraziogallo/game_scoring/releases).
- Unzip it to the location where you want to keep it. Your Mac may ask for you permission at different stage, allow it.
